## DESCRIPTION

I built this project following an unsuccessful 2nd interview with a FinTech company. 👎

The homepage features three tables showing Top Gainers, Top Loser, and Most Actively Traded Tickers on the US Market. If you click on a Ticker's name, it would then take you a page that will provide additional information (if available) about the company and stock to include:

- Company Name and Address
- Company description
- Information on Exchange and Currency Used
- Reported Earnings Per Share in a Line Graph
- Articles related to the company to include market sentiment

## DESIGN AND ASSETS

This project was designed "free hand". While I did find some inspiration from other websites, there was no design pattern or template that I followed.

The homepage tables and the line graph are Material UI components. Some icons are from React-Icons, and some SVGs are from svgrepo.com.

A huge thank you to https://www.alphavantage.co/. Without their free API and excellent documentation, this project would not have been possible.

## GOALS

While I was disappointed about the job, I wouldn't call this a "revenge" project as much as I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of working with finance data. I actually met with a friend who has worked for over 20 years in the finance industry to help understand the many fields and items that the API was providing.

All in all, I just want an opportunity to demonstrate my skills, dedication, and willingness to try new things.

## WISHLIST

There was almost too much data to work with 🤯. And if I had a better understanding of stocks, markets, and finance, I could have probably continued working this project for months. But I am happy with this project and what I was able to accomplish in only two weeks of development.

## INSTALLATION

- Node.js version >= v18.17.0 is required
